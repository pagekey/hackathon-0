Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm excited to announce the beginning of a groundbreaking project here at PageKey â€“ the development of our new Email Assistant. This initiative aims to revolutionize the way we manage email communication, leveraging AI to streamline processes, enhance productivity, and improve user experience.

Zach, with your exceptional skill in software development, Monroe, with your project management prowess, and Lee, with your expertise in AI and machine learning, I believe we have the perfect team to bring this vision to life.

I would like to schedule a kick-off meeting early next week where we can discuss the project's scope, objectives, and your initial thoughts. Please reply with your availability so we can finalize the details.

Looking forward to pioneering this journey with you all.

Best,
Steve Grice"""
